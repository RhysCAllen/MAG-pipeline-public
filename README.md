# MAG-pipeline-public

This public repo summarizes the creation and analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes from shotgun sequence of three previously published peat bog samples. 

One method to learn to analyze metagenomic sequence is to reproduce published analyses. This public repo is a work-in-progress. It is an example of the work I would like to do professionally, and of my current skill level with creating and analyzing MAGs. 

In the interest of space, the DNA sequence files are not duplicated in this public repo, but can be made available upon request.

Files:
1) Lab report, summarizing key findings at various checkpoints in the MAG pipeline.
2) Pipeline .md files describing how MAGs were generated and analyzed. 
3) Utility files, including conda environment .yml files.  
4) Output files from pipeline tools such as FastQC, Krona, Sourmash, CheckM, and anvi'o.
