# MAG-pipeline-public

This public repo summarizes the creation and analysis of metagenome-assembled genomes from shotgun sequence of peat bog samples. 

One method to learn to analyze shotgun metagenomic sequence is to reproduce published analyses. This public repo is a work-in-progress. It is an example of the work I would like to do professionally, and my current level of ability and understanding of creating and working with MAGs. 

In the interest of space, the DNA sequence input and output files are not duplicated in this public repo, but can be made available upon request.

Files:
1) Lab report, summarizing key findings at various checkpoints in the MAG pipeline.  
2) Utility files, including pipeline method .md and conda environment .yml files.  
3) Output files from pipeline tools such as FastQC, Krona, Sourmash, CheckM, and anvi'o.
